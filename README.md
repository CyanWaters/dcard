# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `Architecture`

App.jsx is the main page which have placed 2 available columns and 1 disable column to let users to do the search. \
Also, we have the debounce function to prevent the multiple API calls when user try to typing repo name. Currently, I set the delay time as 600ms.

InfiniteScroll has 3 props, which are following: \
loadMore: executed when scorll down to the bottom. \
component: render the component(ex. Table or Tree list ) whatever you want. \
loading: the state of API call. If true, it means that we still need to wait for data.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

You could input Repo Name to do the search for Github repo.
Input text would have some delay to send back to server which is in order to prevent the multiple API calls.

### `yarn test`

Using Jest to do the Unit Test.
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn webpack`

Using Webpack to bundle the project.
Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
